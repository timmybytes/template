# Template Repo

This is a custom template for quickly getting new Next.js projects up and running with the following opinionated tooling:

- Typescript
- twin.macro
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky+lint-staged hooks
- Jest+React Testing Library
- Atomic component structure
- Plop.js component generators

This template favors my own preferences and configurations, and your own mileage with it may vary.
